""" 
We have an horizontal number line. On that number line, we have gas stations at
positions stations[0], stations[1], ..., stations[N-1], where N = size of the stations
array. Now, we add K more gas stations so that D, the maximum distance between adjacent
gas stations, is minimized. We have to find the smallest possible value of D.
